** I think it will be great

** Told alexey today and gave my notice
** I could tell he was upset and I feel bad, but I'm convinced this is the move for me
** Feeling upset with myself for investing all our money in a lump sum at the beginning of this year
** Now I have nothing to invest now that the market is way way down! Ugh!

** Frustrated. We're getting ready to leave for the wedding and I feel totally unappreciated
** Where the hell is Dan? He's not responding to Rachel so who knows if he's coming or not
** Rachel is mad at me all because I tried to get us squared away on amazon prime. We were paying for a double membership this whole time!
*** Don't understand why she's mad at me but whatever
