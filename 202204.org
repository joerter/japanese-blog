* 2022-04-01
** Had interview with Chefman.
*** I think it went well, but I could have done things better as always
*** We'll see what they say
*** I'm still not sure if it's the right move for me or not...
** I talked with Dagna Bieda about career coaching
*** She seems good but it costs $4000
*** Probably not worth it for me right now
*** I think I can get to where I need to be by marketing myself better on Linkedin and redgreenrefactor
** Rachel and I went to a comedy show!
*** It was so funny because the meetup group was so awkward
* 2022-04-02
** We went to a cider mill. It was very fall and nice
** We got a double order of cider flights and got a little tipsy lol
** We played 4 across and bags
* 2022-04-05
** I had a call with Jordan and Rebecca from glocomms today
** They told me that chefman had an offer for me.
** I told them my initial thoughts which where that I wasn't ready to take an offer
** They were confused since it's the amount of money I asked for, but it just still didn't seem right to me
** I really didn't like Rebecca's tone in particular. She kept tyring to sell me which I didn't like at all
** It turned me off even more to it instead of convincing me
** Then I met with Jon and Jon from wavecx!
*** It seems like the perfect opportunity for me if the pay and benefits line up
*** It would be an opportunity to take ownership and pave the way in a company

** I did some tax work with Brett today.
*** Got caught up on things and he had some trouble with MA
*** They wanted 2k taxes
*** He's gonna figure it out
** Working on SSO at work
*** It's pretty fun actually to figure out
* 2022-04-07
** Working on portal sso today
** Also researching lambda timeouts. Right now we think it could be about serverless version and api gateway caching
* 2022-04-08
** Going to Plymouth today!
* 2022-04-11
** Plymouth weekend was good!
** Went to pearl's bday party, watched F1, and hung out. It was relaxing.
** Working on WaveCX today. I just got the front end setup and am set to work on the video portion now
** I'm doing the team lead activities this week at work. Hopefully i do good!
* 2022-04-12
** I demoed my spike story about SSO today and it went well.
** Rachel's back is still hurting her and I'm worried for her. I'm trying to be empathetic
** I got a haircut that is a bit uneven. I was going for something more modern
* 2022-04-13
** I demoed the SSO stuff at sprint demo today
** Rachel and I went to happy hour at a cool restraunt
** I met up with Shashank and he talked to me about a new project he's working on
* 2022-04-14
** I talked with WaveCX some more.
** I feel like I really understand the product better now, and I really like it
** I think it has a lot of applications and fills in a real gap that's needed to be filled
** Feeling very ignored and rejected by Rachel right now. I guess I need to renew my commitment
* 2022-04-15
** Traveling to Plymouth today
** Working on wavecx
* 2022-04-16
** Pre easter stuff in plymouth!
* 2022-04-17
** Happy Easter!
** Discovered the Jordan Harbinger show and it's pretty good
* 2022-04-18
** Back at it today. Not feeling great. I want to just give up on Rachel initiating anything
** Trying to find birthday gifts for her. I hope she likes them.
** Feeling very blah today.
** Talked with a recruiter from uphold. He had a family emergency and had to leave
* 2022-04-19
** Synced up with Scot from uphold and got a fun take home to work with their api
* 2022-04-20
** Working on SSO still
** Feeling pretty depressed about no affection and no sex
* 2022-04-21
** Rachel asked me to cuddle in the morning and we had sex!
** I still feel like she's not really into it though...
** Talked with Jon about WaveCX
*** I feel better about the offer of 130k + 2% equity
*** I would really like to get to 4%
*** He's going to get back to me on the legal part of the shares, benefits, and more equity
*** My calculation is going to be any offer I can get from Uphold or Dina and calculate what I would get from a buyout and what salary I would be missing

** Rachel's family is being so nice to Penny on her birthday!
* 2022-04-29
** I am getting ready for my Dina interview.
** Not sure how I'm feeling. WaveCX is where my heart wants to be, but it's a big risk
*** No health insurance and marketplace plans would cost us ~$700/month
** Not sure if I would really like working at Dina...
** Well, I just got done with my interview and now I am really excited about it
** It would give me the leadership opportunity I want while working with great people and doing cool stuff
** We'll see. I need to tell WaveCX no now probably. But we'll see if they even give me an offer in the first place
